# Tesla-Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression

Description:

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict Tesla's stock prices based on historical data. The goal was to develop a predictive model that could assist in understanding and forecasting price movements in one of the leading companies in the electric vehicle industry.

Key Features:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Utilized pandas to load and preprocess historical stock price data from a CSV file.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employed matplotlib to visualize the trends and fluctuations in Tesla's stock prices over time.

3. Model Development: Implemented a simple linear regression model to predict the next day's closing price based on the previous day's data.

4. Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to quantify the accuracy of predictions.

5. Visualization: Created visualizations to compare actual versus predicted stock prices, providing insights into the model's effectiveness.
